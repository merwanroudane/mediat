This is a comprehensive and interactive web application built with Streamlit to explain the concepts of mediation analysis in statistics. The application serves as an educational tool for students, researchers, and data scientists who want to understand the mechanisms by which one variable influences another.

Features

In-Depth Explanations: The app is structured into multiple sections covering everything from basic concepts and assumptions to different types of mediation and statistical models (Baron & Kenny, Bootstrap methods, Sobel test).

Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Plotly to create dynamic mediation path diagrams, relationship scatter plots, and bootstrap distribution charts that help in visualizing the concepts.

Live Analysis with pingouin: Demonstrates how to perform mediation analysis in Python using the pingouin library and provides an interactive interface to run the analysis on sample data.

Data Simulation: Allows users to generate their own data by specifying effect sizes for different paths (a, b, c') and sample size, offering a hands-on understanding of how these parameters affect mediation outcomes.

Clear Interpretation: Provides a step-by-step guide on how to interpret the results, including common pitfalls and a detailed breakdown of a sample analysis.

Code Examples: Includes ready-to-use Python code snippets for performing the analyses shown in the application.
